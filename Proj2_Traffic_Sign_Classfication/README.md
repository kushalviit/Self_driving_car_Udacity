## Project: Traffic Sign Classification Using Deep Neural Network

#1. Tensor Flow Library was used.

#2. Architecture OF SermaNET as given in
"Traffic Sign Recognition with Multi-Scale Convolutional Networks"
by Pierre and Yann LeCun was used

#3.For code and Pipeline see [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb).

#4.Training Data_Set and Testing Data_set not Available on git
(It was provided by Udacity).
